### Cascy's Coding Adventure
Embark on a journey through the depths of web design and become a pro with CSS!

---

#### Story
Cascy is looking for one of his lost cascading style sheets. He has lost it in the depths of an open pixel world and is now embarking on a long journey to get this valuable piece back. **Only you can help him** make the hard journey by tackling the story-driven tasks and mastering them with a **cool head** and some **CSS snippets**.

Cascy playfully teaches you the various properties in the language of today's web design, from simple coloring, scaling and shifting of text and containers to fancy animations and media queries that will have you mastering almost all the tools of UI design by the end of the story.

#### Do you already feel confident in web development? Feel free to contribute!

To add to the concept around Cascy's journey through the depths of web development, the actual game was also built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and NodeJS (via Electron Framework).

There are a variety of ways to support the game in its brilliance. Be it **new translations**, **features**, **levels**, **assets**, **sounds**, **music**, **dialogs** or even **bug fixes**.

An information on how to contribute is linked [here](CONTRIBUTING.md). Thank you!

#### Credits & More


With Cascy's Coding Adventure, I hope to be able to give some newcomers to frontend development a helping hand and introduce them to the basics of CSS3. 🚀

But it is not only through active assistance that a project can become what it is. Sometimes it's also the ones who make you do it in the first place!

At this point, I would especially like to mention the [HackClub](https://hackclub.com/) organization, which was able to motivate me to start and develop this project through their [**Arcade 2024**](https://hackclub.com/arcade) event. 🦕
Thank you for this great event and keep up the good work!
